# Hi there, I'm Jilie(Alex) ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently working on full-stack dev. I previously earned my Bachelor's degree in industrial design from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology. Now I am pursuing my Master in information studies at UT Austin.

My interests are web/mobile development and UI/UX design because I want to make my design come true! And I also love manipulating digits!  ðŸ˜‚
