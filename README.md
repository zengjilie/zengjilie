# Hi there, I'm Jilie(Alex) ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on full-stack dev. I previously earned my Bachelor's degree in industrial design from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology. Now pursuing Master's degree in information studies at UT Austin.

My interests are web/mobile developement and UI/UX design, because I want to make my own design come true! And I also love manipulating digits! ðŸ˜‚
